# Description of Your Work

My work is mainly about myself and my aspirations on the future as an entrepreneur. As well as that, there is also information about the degree I am studying (Business Analytics & Computer Engeneering), the subject "Fundamentals of Computer Engeneering", fake news and also some links to other websites.

# Problems During the Development

Actually, it has not been so easy to do it. 
Firstly, I thought about using a template, but later I realized it was not worth it because I would have learned less than either doing it starting from the beginning.
During the website design I found also different obstacles, but fortunately I solved them all. For instance, placing images or divs where I wanted was not that easy.

# Conclusions

I was excited to do my first website, because I knew I would learn a lot. Actually, web developping is a really interesting skill that is without any hesitation very useful for our futures.
