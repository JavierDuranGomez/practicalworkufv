            In today's world, information has become a key element for society, both in everyday life and in the
            business and professional realm.
            Since the advent of computers, the amount of information being handled has grown exponentially, and only a
            tool like the computer is capable of processing such a volume of information in such short times. <br><br>
            For this reason, an engineer must be well-versed in the tool through which information is generated, sent,
            and received. They must understand how these tools function, how they interconnect to create networks,
            how they interface with external devices, and the way in which they provide service to applications.
